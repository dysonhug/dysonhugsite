title: Inis Spraoi - Having fun
---

I'm once again starting a new blog. People who know me know my tendency to completely throw away the old at the drop of a hat, to waste effort on constantly rebuilding things from scratch, to only have less than I had before in slightly new packaging. This may look like those times, but it really doesn't feel like it.

I'm just back now two days from an event called Inis Spraoi, a weekend retreat on an island off the coast. I signed up months in advance when the reality of it was completely intangible and social inertia made sure I followed through and headed along.

The weekend started with a boat ride to the island that was intoxicating. The crashing of the waves, music being played, seeing many old friends, and meeting for the first time many people that seemed so cool, in the many senses of the word. Getting off the boat was a totally different experience. I tend to bring to every situation a huge amount of baggage and projected expectations. I saw the schedule for the weekend and saw a schedule of opportunities for me to let everyone in this group of wonderful people down, a rainbow of ways in which I would underachieve the impossible expectations I set for myself.

It was, honestly, terrified of the weekend to come. On the first night I grabbed one of the organizers and appologised in advance. I wanted to let them know ahead of time that I would not be able to partake in all the events, that my absence would be a predictable diosappointment, rather than a sharp insult. What they told me in response was something I'd never been told before in a way that I could believe. They told me that the schedule wasn't theirs. That it was mine. That there were no expectations. That the point of the weekend wasn't for me to fit in their mold, but to provide a space for me to simply be. It was great to hear but it took almost the full weekend to understand.

I spent a good while by myself, trying to figure out what I was trying to do on the island. Was being along ok? Was being alone another form of escape from failure? It took a while to understand what I'd been told. I'd been given agency. Or rather I'd been granted access to the agency I had always had. There was never anything in the world stopping me from leaving an uncomfortable situation except my expectations. When I sat down at a table of people I barely knew I had no obligation to be the life of the party, no one expected that of me but me.

On the last night there was a bonfire. Earlier in that day I was still on unsure footing, still anxious, but far less so than I had been early in the weekend. I went along and I didn't try to be the version of myself I thought others needed me to be. I sat and sang and joked, happy in the knowledge that at any point I could just walk away. But knowing that I was allowed that tiny degree of self determination melted the baggage away. I was able to have a kind of unencumbered fun that I'd never had before.

It was honestly the first time I'd understood what it was to have fun. I never before understood the degree to which I had control over myself and the role I felt needed to play in social situations. Which is none. I love talking to people. And sharing ideas. And if you get me started philosophising about art or games I may never stop. But no one else needs me to be that person.

On the ferry back, and on the bus back, I said to friends that I felt like I'd learned how to have fun for the first time. What I really learned was that I had agency, control over myself, and that the expectation I was projecting were exactly that. So I don't think this blog will disappear in two weeks, like it normally does. Because, for the first time really, this isn't for others, it's for me.
