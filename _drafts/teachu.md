[Tichu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu) is one of my favorite games. I describe it as chinese bridge but that doesn't really do it justice. It's a very accessible game, which you can play for five minutes or an hour equally entertainingly. And you can almost play it with a standard 52 pack of cards, you just need 4 special cards on top. If you have a full 52 card deck, and 4 jokers you can play the game unchanged.

But I only had a deck of 52 cards over the weekend and I *really* wanted to show some people Tichu for the first time. So I altered the rules slightly and introduced the rules incrementally. I just wanted to note down the changes I made, and how I taught the game, so I don't have to redsign it again!

# Rule changes

The twos are used in place of the jokers to represent the special cards.
- 2♦ : Mahjong. Equivalent to a '2', instead of a '1'.
- 2♥ : Dragon.
- 2♣ : Pheonix.
- 2♠ : Dog.

Grand Tichu is called after the first 7 cards are dealt out, not after the 8th.

# Drip feeding the ruleset.

The rull set was introduced over the course of subsequent rounds.

1. **No Tichu or Grand Tichu calls** - in the first round players will barely have any idea what they're trying to achieve, let alone know if they are going to be able to achieve it. **No wish on the Mahjong** - it's a hard tool to use correctly, no point in using in the first round. **No bombs** - they complicate the hand rankings, it's hard enough to get people away from thinking purely in terms of poker hands.
2. **Introduce tichu calls** - The player knows a bit about how the game works, they have some idea how they succeeded or failed from the first round, now they're being given a chance to use that knowledge at the beginning of the next round. It also lets the player know that it's about the result of multiple games, not just a single one.
3. **Introduce bombs.** **Introduce Mahjong wish**. I think both of these should be held off on until people are happy with the rules without them, but once they are the extra complexity puts a lot of meat on the bones of the game.
