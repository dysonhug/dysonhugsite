[Tichu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu) is one of my favorite games. I describe it as chinese bridge but that doesn't really do it justice. It's a very accessible game, which you can play for five minutes or an hour equally entertainingly. And you can almost play it with a standard 52 pack of cards, you just need 4 special cards on top. If you have a full 52 card deck, and 4 jokers you can play the game unchanged.

But I only had a deck of 52 cards over the weekend and I *really* wanted to show some people Tichu for the first time. So I altered the rules slightly and introduced the rules incrementally. I just wanted to note down the changes I made, and how I taught the game, so I don't have to come up with it again!
