I’m still riding high from Inis Spraoi, and trying to keep the feeling alive. It’s not helped by the fact that I’m writing this blog post for the second time because I’m an idiot and lost it by hitting the back button my mistake (drafting now in Google Docs to prevent myself from sabotaging myself again). I’ve also started reading a book I was recommended called “The Intuitive Eater”. 

I’m quite a bit heavier than I’d like to be, and I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to shed these unsightly pounds and ounces for years now. I’ve tried many many a diet, and failed out of them. The main thrust of this book is that that kind of behaviour leads to all or nothing, obsessive relationships with food that have a tendency to explode, which has definitely been my experience. The book’s suggestion is instead to work hard on trying to relearn how to listen to your body. Your body really does know when it’s hungry and when it’s full. But years of broken relationships with people and food can layer on top of those natural indicators so much noise as to make them unreadable.

As part of trying to keep the Inis Spraoi freedoms alive, and processing the what I’ve been reading I went for a walk this afternoon, which I really should do more of. Along the way I starting thinking about something that I thought would make for quite the good blogpost. I started planning out the post, thinking hard about it. But then I realized I wasn’t enjoying the walk. I’d walked a fair distance without taking any of it in. I’d gone for a walk to clear my head, and immediately I’d started cluttering it up again.

So I let the thought go. I honestly completely forget what the post would have been about. And instead of being worried about losing the details I was juggling I was again enjoying my simple walk. I was happier, for a while. Then I started musing about how letting the thought go had made me feel and I realized that what the book was saying applies to my mind as well.

I really do believe that my mind, deep down, knows how to be healthy. There is a healthy person beneath all the anxiety and depression. I’ve just long forgotten how to listen to that person, how to feed him what he needs. And much in the way I need to listen through the noise of the neuroses to determine whether I’m really hungry / full, I need to learn to listen through them to determine what I really need to thrive healthily.

I think today I took a tiny step towards that, in recognising that I needed silence, and granting it to myself if only for a few moments. This post’s title comes from when I was dancing like a fool in a club and a friend refused to dance because they didn’t know how. I said “not knowing was the point!”, that dancing without encumbrance was the fun of dancing. I think I was more right than I knew. Life is to be danced though, whether you know what you’re doing or not. It’d be a terrible shame to let yourself stand in the corner of your own life for fear of not living it correctly.
